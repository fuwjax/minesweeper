#The Minesweeper Anti-Challenge

Interviewing is difficult. I could go into the problems, but if you'd done any interviews, you know. It's hard.

Like any hard work, it's easily justifiable as long as there is something to show for the effort. But too many interviews with too many "poor" candidates and you'll be introducing bad ideas on top of worse ideas to increase the weed-out-ability of your process - recruiters with pages of whitelisted and blacklisted keywords or technical phone screens with superficial problems aren't giving us what we need.

We think we want "weed-out" but what we really want is a conversation. And to have a good conversation, we need context.

Enter this project. Make some changes. Submit a pull request. Let's talk about it.
